# ComiXed Plugin Language Python

This project provides a language runtime for ComiXed that executes plugins
written in [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/).

It does **not** provide the full Groovy language's runtime libraries. Instead,
it only provides the core **language** interpreter to execute plugins.
